# Fast_Algorithms
A collection of fast algorithms written by myself. (Anything which is the work of others will be dually noted). There will be Parallel Versions of the algorithms which are adaptable to this paradigm.

The goal is to make the routine as efficient as possible. If a decision has to be made between computational and space complexity, I will many times go with the later, or include versions that are optimized for both domains.

I hope to supply code in C/C++ Java. C#, and python.
